    Note right of browser: The user writes a new note and clicks the 'Save' button.

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    Note right of browser: The browser's JavaScript prevents the default form submission and sends the new note as a JSON object.
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTTP 201 Created (with the new note object)
